## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- I make sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
- If you've never contributed before, see [the first timer's guide on our blog](https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/) by Auth0.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

### Pull Requests

PRs are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement you desire. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question.
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Be as much as descriptive on the changes you've made to the code.

In general, follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
